        <P>Having beaten every other Test playing nations in a series, a trophy against England had long eluded Bangladesh but Shakib Al Hasan and the Tigers' plans went according to script in the second T20I yesterday as they scaled a new peak with a maiden T20I series triumph over the reigning T20 and ODI world champions England after a four-wicket win in Mirpur.</P>
        <P>Najmul Hossain Shanto and Taskin Ahmed were pumping fists in the air, almost in sync as the latter found back-to-back boundaries to finish off the game -- a moment of utter relief grabbed the Tigers after the game swung late. Shanto was once again the hero with the bat, coming in at the third over, taking the game deep and prevailing with a 47-ball 46 to guide the team over the ropes.</P>
        <P>The bowlers set up the series win yesterday, just as death-bowling had set up the first T20I in Chattogram. Taskin Ahmed began with fire and angled one across in the third over which led to the planned dismissal of Dawid Malan, who skied it to third man.</P>
        <P>England, however, moved fast to 50 for one by the end of powerplay before Shakib brought himself on and created the right disturbance with a leg-stump line to dismiss Phil Salt for a 19-ball 25.

            Hasan Mahmud possibly bowled the delivery of the game, a yorker shaping in to uproot Jos Buttler's stumps and England, a batter short, never looked threatening from that point.</P>
        <P>All-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz's inclusion, brought on by the four left-handers in the England top and middle-order, worked like a charm for Bangladesh. The patch of grass present at the media end of the wicket helped slow up deliveries just a tad. There was turn as well and the Bangladesh spinners used the patch to their advantage.</P>
        <p>Moeen swept one at straight to deep mid-wicket against the spin but Sam Curran stitched a 34-run partnership with Ben Duckett until Miraz returned in his second spell to undone Curran with a quicker, out stumped. Miraz struck again in the 15th over, bagging Chris Woakes, this time an even better glove work from wicketkeeper Liton Das led to the dismissal. Chris Jordan became Miraz's fourth victim in the 17th, leaving England 100 for seven before Duckett departed in the 20th over, courtesy of a brilliant running catch by Shanto off the bowling of Mustafizur, and eventually England were restricted to a subpar 117.

            The Bangladesh chase triggered nervy moments for the packed stadium amidst the oohs and aahs. The wicket had slowed down enough for Liton and Rony Talukdar to mistime deliveries, while Towhid Hridoy looked good before he fell after scoring 17.</p>
    
    
    <p>Miraz was promoted up the order and his vital 16-ball 20 produced the decisive partnership with Shanto to take Tigers from 56 for three to 97 for four. Shakib soon fell for a three-ball duck and Jofra Archer showed fearsome pace to leave Afif Hossain's bails flying towards the third-man boundary. Needing 13 off 12 deliveries, Shanto and Taskin found both courage and boundaries to ultimately seal victory with seven balls to spare as the Tigers, with a young side, ushered in a turnaround in fortunes in the T20I format.</p>
